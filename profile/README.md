# Boring Configs

Preconfigured applications for developers.

You might find these useful if:
- You want to use Vim like keybindings everywhere
- You want to avoid conflicting key bindings
- You want consistent theming (=catppuccin everywhere <3)
- Overall, want to focus in the *boring* work instead of configuring.

## Installation

> [!warning] 
> This assumes you are doing a fresh install. If you have existing configurations
> for the app you are installing, the installation might break things.

1. Clone any of the `boring.*` repos.
2. `cd` the cloned repository, and install with `make`.
